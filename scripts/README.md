## Example Camera2 Movement Scripts

This folder contains movement scripts that were created with the `example.blend` and `example-advanced.blend` files. You can create these movement scripts yourself by running the `b2c2_export.py` script in Blender.

`release_b2c2_main.json` contains the movement script I used to create my LUVORATORRRRRY! video.

You can load these scripts into your own Beat Saber + Camera2 installation and play them, if you want.
