## Template Versions

These files were designed around B2C2 v1.0:

* example.blend
* example-advanced.blend
* release.blend

They should still work fine with B2C2 v1.1+. If you run into any issues with things looking weird in Beat Saber, try exporting with B2C2 v1.0.

You should always use the latest version of B2C2 when working with the template file.
