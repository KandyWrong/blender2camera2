## What can I do with it?

The python script and the Blender templates give you a way to use Blender to create fully customized movement scripts for the Beat Saber Camera2 plugin.

If you're in a hurry then have a look at some screenshots from my LUVORATORRRRRY! Beat Saber video below, or [watch the whole thing on YouTube](https://youtu.be/ISJmNQHka8I).

## What's in here?

* A Blender template file (so you don't have to create your own)
