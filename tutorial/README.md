## Example Camera2 Movement Scripts

This folder contains two Blender files: `example.blend` and `example-advanced.blend` files. These files were created by following the tutorial at https://kandywrong.com/b2c2/tutorial.html.

This folder also contains two JSON files, one for each Blender file. These files contain movement scripts that were generated using the Blender files and the b2c2_export.py script.

You can load these scripts into your own Beat Saber + Camera2 installation and play them, if you want.
