## Installing Movement Scripts

This folder contains a pack of movement scripts and associated camera configurations. You don't have to mess around with editing cameras. Just copy, paste, and play.

1. In the `blender2camera2\releases` folder, select `Cameras` and `Movementscripts`. __Copy__ (Ctrl + C) these folders.
2. In your `Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\UserData\Camera2` folder, __Paste__ (Ctrl + V) these folders.

If Windows prompts you to overwrite anything, verify that the files don't already exist (they probably don't), and then click __Yes__ to transfer the files.

The new cameras (and the movement scripts) will be available under the Camera2 plugin menu within Beat Saber.

## B2C2_luvo_60fps.json

* Designed for use with *Reol - LUVORATORRRRRY!* (bsaber 4cfb), or any pop / dance track with high BPM.
* This script runs at 60FPS.
* If you aren't sure which *LUVORATORRRRRY!* script to use, use this one.

## B2C2_sunset.json

* Designed for use with *Sunset Neon - Tonight* (bsaber 3d13), or any track with mid BPM.
* This script runs at 60FPS.
* This script works best for collabs, but will still work just fine when running solo.

## B2C2_tokyo.json

* Designed for use with *Tokyo Machine - PLAY (nitronik.exe remix)* (bsaber 17e36), or any electronic / dance track with high BPM.
* This script runs at 60FPS.

## (Bonus Script) B2C2_megamix.json

* This script is ~10 minutes long. It is a combination of all four scripts listed above.
* This script runs at 60FPS.

This release includes 2 additional movement scripts that technically *work*, but might not work the way you want:

## B2C2_lucky_partial.json

* Designed for use with *Celldweller - The Lucky One* (bsaber 11bfd)
* This script runs at 60FPS.
* This camera path is incomplete. It runs from 2:13 to 3:40.
* The camera is static outside this time range.

## B2C2_luvo_120fps.json

* Designed for use with *Reol - LUVORATORRRRRY!* (bsaber 4cfb)
* This script runs at 120FPS. If you are concatenating scripts, use reol_luvo_60fps.json.
* This script was exported with B2C2 v1.0, which was buggy. You will not get the same results with B2C2 v1.1 and newer.
* You may notice strange stuttering when running this script at a frame rate other than some multiple of 60FPS (90, 144, etc).
